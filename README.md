# work_day_scheduler

>The purpose of this assignment was to create a day planner so that the user can keep track of important tasks. The planner is setup between 9am - 5pm business standard time, and the timeblocks are color coded to indicate past, present or future tasks. Items are saved to local storage and persist when the page is refreshed. The current date and time are also incorporated using the moment.js api.
